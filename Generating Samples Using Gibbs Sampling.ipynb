    "### How to do Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "The reason for doing Gibbs sampling is to generate samples $\\mathcal{S}$ from known parameters $W$ and then use MPF to learn the parameters $W$ using $\\mathcal{S}$. To sample from this multivariate distribution, we start with an initial state obtained from a prior belief, following which sampling from the conditional distribution is done to get a new state of a **vertex**. Thus if we were to sample each vertex sequentially, a network with $v$ vertices would require sampling from (different) conditional distributions $v$ times for a new state of the network to be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm: Gibbs sampler (cycle)\n",
    "1. Initialize $\\mathbf{x^{(0)}}=(x_1^{(0)},\\ldots,x_v^{(0)})$ base on some prior belief.\n",
    "2. For $i = 1,2, \\ldots$\n",
    "    - sample $X_1^{(i)}\\sim \\mathbb{P}(X_1^{(i)}=x_1^{(i)}\\mid X_2=x_2^{(i-1)},\\ldots,X_v=x_v^{(i-1)})$\n",
    "    - sample $X_2^{(i)}\\sim \\mathbb{P}(X_2^{(i)}=x_2^{(i)}\\mid X_1=x_1^{(i)},X_3=x_3^{(i-1)}\\ldots,X_v=x_v^{(i-1)})$\n",
    "    - in general, sample $X_j^{(i)}\\sim \\mathbb{P}(X_{j}^{(i)}=x_{j}^{(i)}\\mid X_1=x_1^{(i)},\\ldots, X_{j-1}=x_{j-1}^{(i)},X_{j+1}=x_{j+1}^{(i-1)},\\ldots,X_v=x_v^{(i-1)})$ for $j=1,2, \\ldots v$, which then generates a new state for the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another variation of the Gibbs sampler called the **random scan** where the update of the state of the vertex is not in a cycle but done in a random manner. Below are some functions that are defined for the implementation of the Gibbs sampler."
